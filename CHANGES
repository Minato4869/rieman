version 1.2.0: 2021-01-03

    * changed configuration file format due to removing libxml dependency
      now files use '.conf' extension and use simple key-value syntax.
      use scripts/migrate_to_conf.sh to convert existing configuration files
      into new format

    + Tiling support: for WMs lacking it
      Since rieman knows about all windows and can send commands to them,
      it was simple to add 'tile windows on click at specific desktop'
      feature. See man for details.

    + Control socket support
      you can send commands to running instance via UNIX socket.
      Everything that could be done with signals and more.
      More commands are expected in future versions.
      Why? Not all WMs can deal with 2D-desktops grid and provide commands
      to switch desktop in horizontal/vertical direction.

    + NET_WM_STRUT family of atoms are supported. Rieman may now be configured
      to reserve space on screen in compatible WMs.
      Now it is also possible to set window type to 'dock'.
      Window position handling is improved.

    + X11 screen to use is now configurable

    + Root window geometry is now tracked

    + Psedo-transparency works properly with multiple monitors
